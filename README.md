### Test
Note： There are a number of problems with cv2 importing, including a possible cv2 compatibility error even if OpenCV is downloaded. I have python 3.8, 3.9 and 3.11 on my computer, so I need to force 3.8 (the python environment that contains the cv2 library) to be selected for the system to solve the problem.
